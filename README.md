## Getting Started
Why another grid? So the way we talk about the grid is the same code we write. Demo page coming soon.

```shell
npm install ragrid --save-dev
yarn add ragrid
```



### Build
If you are cloning this repo, 2 npm scripts are available for ya:

```shell
npm run ragrid # no watch, just convert the stylus
npm run crunch # minify css file for open source use
```

## Why
Why another grid? I'd like the way we talk about the grid, to be the same way we code the grid. Also, this grid also opts to align and distribute elements, making more flexible components and layouts then can be achieved with a 12 column grid.

[Check out the demo & docs site](https://argyleink.github.io/ragrid/).


## Using
```shell
npm i ragrid -D
yarn add ragrid
bower i ragrid
```


### Building
Feel free to clone and build this project yourself:
```shell
npm run ragrid # no watch, just convert the stylus
npm run crunch # minify css file for open source use
```

## Why
Why another grid? So the way we talk about the grid, is the same way we code the grid.

[Check out the demo & docs site](https://argyleink.github.io/ragrid/).


## Using
```shell
npm i ragrid -D
yarn add ragrid
bower i ragrid
```


### Building
Feel free to clone and build this project yourself:
```shell
npm run ragrid # no watch, just convert the stylus
npm run crunch # minify css file for open source use
```
